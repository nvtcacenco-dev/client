## About The Project


### Why a webshop?

I have built this project to practice, and later on showcase my techical knowledge within the field of web & frontend development. 

### What did I learn?

Throughout the project I have learned (and continue to improve) concepts such as: 

* State management - both local and global.
* Optimization.
* API design, architecture and integration.
* Various frontend-centric libraries eg. framer-motion.

If we are to widen the scope to broader subjects, then I have also learned to:

* Set realistic deadlines and goals.
* A project can be iterated on indefinitely, and will be iterated on throughout the development. Be it architecture or design choices.
* Choosing the right tool for the right task. Sure you can hammer in a nail with a screwdriver, but is that really the optimal way?
