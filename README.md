## About The Project
TrendThread is demo project of a fully functioning and interactive webshop.

### Why a webshop?

I have built this project to practice, and later on showcase my techical knowledge within the field of web & frontend development.
I have previously worked on various pet projects such as a chess game built from scratch in JavaScript, but have now migrated to more business relevant topics. Which brings us to a webshop.
E-commerce is an ever expanding field in our world, and there is always a company that wants to partake in it, be it globally or locally.

### What did I learn?

Throughout the project I have learned (and continue to improve) concepts such as: 

* State management - both local and global.
* Optimization.
* API design, architecture and integration.
* Various frontend-centric libraries eg. framer-motion.

If we are to widen the scope to broader subjects, then I have also learned to:

* Set realistic deadlines and goals.
* A project can be iterated on indefinitely, and will be iterated on throughout the development. Be it architecture or design choices.
* Choosing the right tool for the right task. Sure you can hammer in a nail with a screwdriver, but is that really the optimal way?

To expand on the last point, after working for months on this project I slowly started to realize that the MERN stack wasn't necessarily the best option. 
No matter how much I optimized, tinkered or adjusted the code, I could not reach the same lightning fast speeds as other commercially avaliable webshop. And they had thousands of products.
Yes I could negate some of the issues with lazy loading, loading spinners and loading skeletons, but it was just a bandiad.
This piqued my curiosity and I dove deeper into the rabbit hole of optimization. From my research I had two options:

1) Use a CDN to deliver pre-rendered pages - which to me felt like treating the symptoms and not the core issue.
2) Use the right tool for the right job - the obvious solution was SSR with Next.js, which is what I'm currently working on right now, namely migrating to Next.js and most likely creating a new big project utilizing this knowledge.

I have as a personal goal, set a restriction on myself. I have refused to use guides, templates or pre-built components unless I could build something similar, in functionality and visually, myself.
This has given me a great and fun environment to expand my knowledge, develop my skills and further distance myself from the "I don't know how to do this, let me google it/find a library"-thought process.
